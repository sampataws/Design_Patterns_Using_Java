    //Why using syncronized:
    /*
    The above code will work hunky dory as long as the application is single threaded. As soon as multiple threads start using the class,
    there's a potential that multiple objects get created. Here's one example scenario:

Thread A calls the method getInstance and finds the onlyInstance to be null but before it can actually new-up the instance it gets context switched out.
Now thread B comes along and calls the getInstance method and goes on to new-up the instance and returns the AirforceOne object.
When thread A is scheduled again, is when the mischief begins. The thread was already past the if null condition check and will
proceed to new-up another object of AirforceOne and assign it to onlyInstance. Now there are two different AirforceOne objects out in the wild,
one with thread A and one with thread B.
There are two trivial ways to fix this race condition.
